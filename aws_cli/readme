Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) is the Amazon Web Service you use to create and run virtual machines in the cloud. AWS calls these virtual machines 'instances'.

1. Launch a Linux Virtual Machine.
	
	a. EC2 Launch Instance Wizard or AWS CLI command to create new instances.
	    Select AMI (windows, Linux or other), instances type (default t2.micro for free), Launch.
	    RHEL-7.4_HVM-20180103-x86_64-2-Hourly2-GP2 (ami-0b1e356e)
		
	b. Create new key pair save to local (ex. C:\user\{yourusername}\.ssh\MyKeyPair.pem).
	
	c. Connect instance from 
	   Windows using Git Bash terminal. 
	      enter ssh -i 'c:\hwang\AWS\domekey.pem' ec2-user@52.27.212.125
	
	   Linux using Putty or VM as terminal:
		  enter ssh -i 'c:\hwang\AWS\domekey.pem' ec2-user@52.27.212.125
		
	d. Terminate. at EC2 Console, select the box next to the instance you created.  Then click the Actions button, navigate to Instance State, and click Terminate.	
	
2. Launch a Windows Vitual Machine.
	
	a. EC2 Launch Instance Wizard or AWS CLI command to create new instances.
	    Select AMI instances type, Launch.
	    Microsoft Windows Server 2012 R2 Base
		
	b. Create new key pair save to local (ex. C:\user\{yourusername}\.ssh\MyKeyPair.pem).

	c. Connect instance from Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) client.
	     The User name defaults to Administrator
         To receive your password, click Get Password/Choose File/demokey.pem/Decrypt Password.
		 
	d. Terminate. at EC2 Console, select the box next to the instance you created.  Then click the Actions button, navigate to Instance State, and click Terminate.	

3. Run a Serverless "Hello, World!" with AWS Lambda.
     Launch AWS\Service\Compute\Lambda => AWS Lambda console 
	 https://us-east-2.console.aws.amazon.com/lambda/home?region=us-east-2#/home
	 
	 exports.handler = (event, context, callback) => {
    // Succeed with the string "Hello world!"
    callback(null, 'Hello world!');
	};
	Click Run button
	
	Click create function
	Select Blueprints
	In the Filter box, type in hello-world-python and select the hello-world-python blueprint.
	Configure and Create Your Lambda Function
	
4. Deploy Docker Containers on Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS)
	
	Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) is the Amazon Web Service you use to run Docker applications on a scalable cluster.
	
    Amazon ECS is a highly scalable, high performance container management service that supports Docker containers and allows you to easily run applications on a managed cluster of Amazon EC2 instances.

5. Create and Query a NoSQL Table with Amazon DynamoDB.

	create a simple table, add data, scan and query the data, delete data, and delete the table using the DynamoDB Console. DynamoDB is a fully managed NoSQL database that supports both document and key-value store models. Its flexible data model, reliable performance, and automatic scaling of throughput capacity, makes it a great fit for mobile, web, gaming, ad tech, IoT, and many other applications.

6. Create and Connect to a MySQL Database with Amazon RDS.

7. Create and Connect to a MariaDB Database with Amazon RDS.

8. Create and Connect to a Microsoft SQL Server Database with Amazon RDS
